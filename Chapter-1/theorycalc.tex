Below the factorization structure of the double differential jet production cross section is displayed in the context of Soft-Collinear Effective Theory, SCET, following the framework for inclusive jet production $pp \rightarrow jet + X$ developed in for jets of  %https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00790

\frac{d \sigma}{ d p_{T} d m}=\sum_{a b c} f_{a}\left(x_{a}, \mu\right) \otimes f_{b}\left(x_{b}, \mu\right) \otimes H_{a b}^{c}\left(x_{a}, x_{b}, p_{T} / z, \mu\right) \otimes \mathcal{G}_{c}\left(z, p_{T} R, m, \mu, z_{\mathrm{cut}}, \beta\right)

Dijets make quark gluon admixture %cite SMP-16-10
Z+Jets make mostly light quark jets, studied here and in 7 TeV analysis (1 D unfolding there and no soft drop)

% This similarity allows us to interpret the variations in quark enriched and gluon enriched jet samples in terms of the fundamental $C_F$ and adjoint $C_A$ casimirs, in $SU(3)$ ,   $C_F = \frac{4}{3}$ and $C_A=3$. 


%Comparing the probability of a quark to emit a gluon and that of a gluon to to emit a gluon we can see the ratio will give simply $\frac{C_A}{C_F} =\frac{9}{4} $. This has strong experimental implications since it implies gluon jets will on average be composed of about twice as many constituent particles as quark jets.
