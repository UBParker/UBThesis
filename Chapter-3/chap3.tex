\section{Trigger}

The data are collected with single-lepton triggers, with muons (electrons) of $pt > 29 (37)$ GeV using the Isolated muon above 27 \GeV (Tight working point electron above 35 \GeV GSF $ || $ Photon above 200 \GeV) triggers, as recommended by the muon (egamma) POG. All triggers used for this analysis are prescaled to 1.

\section{Summary}

In conclusion, we have presented a differential jet cross section measured in Z + Jet events in
bins of the ungroomed jet $\pt$ in conjunction with the ungroomed and groomed
jet mass (as well as dimensionless mass) using the ``soft drop'' (a.k.a. ``modified mass drop
tagger'') algorithm with 9 different combinations of parameters. 
The results are presented as the normalized cross section, normalized per reconstructed jet $\pt$ bin. 
Overall leading-order MC simulation agrees
reasonably well with the data within our uncertainties. 
Agreement below the Sudakov peak is slightly
worse than above. The application of a grooming algorithm
improves the overall precision, with larger improvement at low jet masses. 
This analysis improves over previous iterations by using various parameter values for the ``soft drop''
jet grooming algorithm, as well as by including an additional unfolding in both transverse momentum
and dimensionless mass, as was done by the ATLAS collaboration \cite{Aaboud:2017qwh} .
