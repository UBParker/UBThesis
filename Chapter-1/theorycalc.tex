\section{Jets Initited by Quarks and Gluons }\label{jetgroom:ch1}



earlier discussed $C_F = \frac{4}{3}$ and $C_A=3$ 

CITE A Theory of Quark vs. Gluon Discrimination
% https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01639.pdf

Dijets make quark gluon admixture %cite SMP-16-10
Z+Jets make mostly light quark jets, studied here and in 7 TeV analysis (1 D unfolding there and no soft drop)




% This similarity allows us to interpret the variations in quark enriched and gluon enriched jet samples in terms of the fundamental $C_F$ and adjoint $C_A$ casimirs, in $SU(3)$ ,   $C_F = \frac{4}{3}$ and $C_A=3$. 


%Comparing the probability of a quark to emit a gluon and that of a gluon to to emit a gluon we can see the ratio will give simply $\frac{C_A}{C_F} =\frac{9}{4} $. This has strong experimental implications since it implies gluon jets will on average be composed of about twice as many constituent particles as quark jets.
