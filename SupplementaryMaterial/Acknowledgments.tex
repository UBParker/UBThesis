I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Dr. Nicholas H. Mastronarde, my mentor, for his unlimited guidance, care, and support throughout my Ph.D. studies at the University at Buffalo. Dr. Mastronarde has not only shown me how to conduct groundbreaking research, but also how to be a productive member of the Academy.

I wish to thank Dr. Karthik Dantu for his insights on doing high-quality system's research, and my dissertation committee members Dr. Dimitris A. Pados, Dr. Weifeng Su, and Dr. Josep M. Jornet for their invaluable input and support.

My thanks also extend to Dr. Stella N. Batalama, Dr. Katharine Bartelo, Ms. Kimberly Kriz, Ms. Bin Chen, and Mr. Jason Tillman, for their generous care and encouragement during the hardest times of my Ph.D. journey.

I want to thank all my former and present colleagues,~~especially Prince Joseph, Dylan Elliott, Wei Shao, Alvin Alba, Jean Santiuste, and Farshad Ghanei. I feel extremely lucky to have worked with them during my Ph.D. studies. They made my life at UB more colorful and have enriched me with a lot of precious memories.

Last, but not least, I would like to thank my wife and my parents for their unconditional love and support.
