\section{The Compact Muon Solenoid}\label{sec:ch2:cms}

The Compact Muon Solenoid, CMS, is one of 4 detectors that measure collisions of protons and lead ions produced by the Large Hadron Collider, LHC, at CERN. CMS is the smaller of the 2 large general-purpose detectors, the other being ATLAS. The most notable feature of the detector is it's powerful 3.8 Tesla solenoid magnet, the largest superconducting magnet ever built, as of the year 2011.
